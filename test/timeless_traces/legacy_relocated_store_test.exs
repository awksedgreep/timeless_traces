defmodule TimelessTraces.LegacyRelocatedStoreTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Migrating a legacy store whose address changed, or which lost a block.

  `blocks.file_path` is recorded absolute, so a store that moves — restored
  backup, remounted container volume, renamed host path — carries rows pointing
  at where it used to live. The legacy engine rehomes those by basename on
  startup; the migration reader has to agree with it, or a perfectly healthy
  store that merely changed address cannot be converted at all. Because the
  conversion runs during `init/1`, disagreeing does not degrade the migration,
  it stops the application from booting.

  The same applies to a block the index still lists but that is no longer on
  disk. The legacy engine prunes the row and carries on; aborting instead would
  report a stale row as store corruption and tell the operator to restart, which
  can never make the file reappear.

  What must NOT happen is silently converting fewer spans than the store holds,
  so these assert the exact surviving count rather than merely that it booted.
