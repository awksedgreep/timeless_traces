defmodule TimelessTraces.EngineVocabularyTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The engine option refuses values it does not understand.

  The three Timeless packages spell their previous-generation engine
  differently — `:elixir` here, `:rust` in timeless_metrics — and they used to
  resolve an unrecognised value in opposite directions: this package fell
  through to its legacy engine, while timeless_metrics fell through to libSQL. The
  same typo therefore downgraded one signal and upgraded another, in silence
  and with no way to notice.

  Falling back to the legacy engine was the quieter half of that: the store
  keeps working, so nothing looks wrong, and the operator simply never gets the
  engine they configured.
